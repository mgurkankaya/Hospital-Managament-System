Hospital Management Project

This project, which I have prepared using C# and SQL (ADO.NET), includes patient, doctor, and secretary panels.

Through the patient panel, you can create a new user, schedule an appointment, and communicate your complaints to your doctor.

Through the doctor panel, you can edit the doctor's user information, view appointments, and view announcements.

Through the secretary panel, you can add new doctor records, create announcements, edit appointments, and manage patient procedures.
